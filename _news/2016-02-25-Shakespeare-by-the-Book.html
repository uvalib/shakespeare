copy: "Link and copy lines in a news article file are expected; thus HTML will be generated for those sections whether these fields do not exist or are empty strings. For example, if you leave the "link" value as an empty string then HTML will still be generated for a hyperlink and when the mouse is hovered over the title it will work like a link. But it will just wind up reloading the current page."
