      The University of Virginia presents an exhibition to celebrate the vibrant,
      complex, and sometimes contentious history of bringing Shakespeare's works
      into print. From early editions, to contemporary artists' books, and from
      massive folios to microminiature editions, the exhibition offers visitors a
      glimpse into the varied riches of the Albert and Shirley Small Special
      Collections Library's Shakespeare collections. Installed in our main gallery,
      the exhibition includes over 100 items.
