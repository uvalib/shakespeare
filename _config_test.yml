  This exhibition marks the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death by
  celebrating how his works have come to life through innovations in print
  technology, editorial practice, and graphic design. Books and printing
  artifacts drawn from Special Collections’ eclectic holdings will explain
  the technology of printed books in the 17th century, narrate the complex
  editorial history of the plays, and survey the myriad forms Shakespeare’s
  works have taken in print over the last two centuries. Visitors will see
  both our oldest and most radically modern Shakespeare volumes, learn about
  U.Va.’s special role in the history of Shakespeare scholarship, and
  encounter more than 100 miniature volumes dedicated to the playwright and
  his works.
